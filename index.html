          <h3>Max Yasgur</h3>
          <p>Max was born on the 15th December 1919</p>
          <p>Yasgur was born in New York City to Russian Jewish immigrants Samuel and Bella Yasgur</p>
          <p>He was raised on the family's farm and attended New York University, studying real estate law</p>
          <p>By the late 1960s, he was the largest milk producer in Sullivan County, New York</p>
          <p>At the time of the festival in 1969, Yasgur was married and had a son and daughter</p>
          <p>His son, Sam Yasgur, was an assistant district attorney in New York City at the time</p>
          <p>Yasgur was 49 at the time of the festival and had a heart condition. He said at the time that he never expected the festival to be so large, but that "if the generation gap is to be closed, we older people have to do more than we have done</p>
          <p>Yasgur quickly established a rapport with the concert-goers, providing food at cost or for free</p>
          <p>At the time of the concert, friends described Yasgur as an individualist, who was motivated as much by his principles as by the money</p>
        </div>
        <div class="locations">
          <h3>The Farm</h3>
          <p>Yasgur's farm was located in Bethel, New York</p>
          <p>After Saugerties and Wallkill declined to provide a venue for the festival, Yasgur leased one of his farm's fields for a fee that festival sponsors said was $10,000</p>
          <p>Soon afterward he began to receive both threatening and supporting phone calls some of which threatened to burn his farm down</p>
          <p>Opposition to the festival began soon after the festival's relocation to Bethel was announced. Signs were erected around town, saying, "Stop Max's Hippie Music Festival. No 150,000 hippies here. Buy no milk."</p>
          <p>When he heard that some local residents were reportedly selling water to people coming to the concert, he put up a big sign at his barn on New York State Route 17B reading "Free Water." The New York Times reported that Yasgur "slammed a work-hardened fist on the table and demanded of some friends, 'How can anyone ask money for water?'"" His son Sam recalled his father telling his children to "take every empty milk bottle from the plant, fill them with water and give them to the kids, and give away all the milk and milk products we had at the dairy."</p>
          <p>According to Sam Yasgur, his father agreed to rent the field to the festival organizers because it was a very wet year, which curtailed hay production. The income from the rental would offset the cost of purchasing thousands of bales of hay./p>

          <h3>Death and Legacy</h3>
          <p>Many of his neighbors turned against him after the festival, and he was no longer welcome at the town general store, but he never regretted his decision to allow the concert on his farm</p>
          <p>In 1971, Yasgur sold the 600-acre (2.4 km2) farm, and moved to Marathon, Florida where a year and a half later he died of a heart attack at the age of 53</p>
          <p>He was given a full-page obituary in Rolling Stone magazine, one of the few non-musicians to have received such an honor</p>
          <p>In 1997, the site of the concert and 1,400 acres (5.7 km2) surrounding it was purchased by Alan Gerry for the purpose of creating the Bethel Woods Center for the Arts. In August 2007, the 103-acre (0.42 km2) parcel that contains Yasgur's former homestead was placed on the market for $8 million by its current owner, Roy Howard. The Woodstock site had been the locale of frequent reunions</p>
          <p>Joni Mitchell's song "Woodstock" (also covered by Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, Matthews Southern Comfort, Richie Havens, Eva Cassidy, and Brooke Fraser) refers to "Yasgur's Farm</p>
          <p>Portland, Maine</p>

          <p>Suite 108</p>
